# HTML Webpage Project

This project is a semantic HTML-only implementation of a webpage based on a provided Figma design. The goal of this phase is to replicate the structure and content of the design using clean, accessible, and well-organized HTML5. No CSS or JavaScript is included at this stage â€” this is purely the foundation of the webpage.

The page includes several common layout components such as:

- A header with a logo and navigation links
- A main banner section with headings, descriptive text, and a call-to-action button
- A section featuring multiple content blocks with images and text
- A quote or testimonial section
- A list of video previews with titles, descriptions, authors, and ratings
- Membership or pricing section with call-to-action buttons
- A frequently asked questions (FAQ) section
- A footer with a logo, social media icons, and footer text

All HTML elements have been chosen with semantics and accessibility in mind. Proper use of <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, and appropriate heading levels ensure that the structure is meaningful and ready for styling in future phases.

This project serves as the base for the upcoming CSS implementation, where design, layout, typography, and responsiveness will be applied to match the original Figma layout.
