## 🔠 Fonts Used

If your computer doesn’t have the fonts used in the design, download and install them from:

- [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle)

## 🧩 Responsive Design

The layout is responsive and includes a mobile version.

- The **mobile layout** activates when the screen width is **480px or less**
- Content layout switches to a stacked design for better mobile UX
- **Max content width:** `1000px`, centered on the page

---

## 🖱️ Interactions

The website includes interactive styles per Figma guidelines:

- **Link hover/active color:** `#FF6565`
- **Button hover/active state:** `opacity: 0.9`

All buttons and links reflect these states to match design expectations.

## 🔧 Development Notes

- Some spacing and sizing in Figma may appear in **floating-point values** — they’ve been **rounded** to nearest integers for simplicity and consistency in CSS.
- Images, SVGs, and assets were exported from Figma where necessary.
- The layout uses **Flexbox** and other modern CSS techniques.
